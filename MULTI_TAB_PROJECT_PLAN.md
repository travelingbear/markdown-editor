- **Tab Persistence**: Yes, across sessions
- **Max Tabs**: 50 tabs maximum
- **Auto-save**: No auto-save for unsaved tabs
- **Tab Features**: Accessed from the bottom right (where the name of the current opened file is located, Shows the most recent five opened files and a "More" button, Opens a modal showing a list of the files, if more than 5, Close buttons (X), drag-to-reorder, no file type icons
- **Fallback**: Maintain existing single-file functionality
- **Git Strategy**: New branch per phase, merge only after validation

## Git Branch Strategy

### Branch Naming Convention
- `feature/component-architecture`
- `feature/single-instance`
- `feature/tab-management`
- `feature/enhanced-tabs`
- `feature/tab-sessions`
- `feature/performance-optimization`
- `feature/css-modularization`
- `feature/integration-polish`

### Merge Process
1. Create feature branch from `main`
2. Implement phase requirements
3. Self-test all success criteria
4. Request validation from Francisco
5. Only merge to `main` after explicit approval
6. Tag release after each major phase

### Version Strategy
- Phase 1-2: v2.2.0 (Component Architecture)
- Phase 3-4: v2.3.0 (Tab System)
- Phase 5-6: v2.4.0 (Tab Features & Performance)
- Phase 7-8: v2.5.0 (CSS Modularization & Polish)

## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk Items
- **Performance with many tabs**: Implement lazy loading early
- **Monaco editor memory leaks**: Proper disposal of editor instances
- **State management complexity**: Keep component boundaries clear

### Fallback Plans
- If single-instance fails: Graceful degradation to multi-instance
- If performance issues: Implement tab limits and warnings
- If drag-drop issues: Provide alternative reordering method

## Success Metrics
- **Functionality**: 100% existing features preserved
- **Performance**: < 2s startup with 10 tabs, < 100ms tab switching
- **Memory**: < 50MB per tab average
- **Stability**: No crashes with 100 tabs
- **UX**: Smooth animations, responsive UI
