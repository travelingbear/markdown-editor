## ⚠️ **CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT RULES - STRICTLY ENFORCED**

### **GIT WORKFLOW - MANDATORY**
- ❌ **NEVER work directly on main branch**
- ❌ **NEVER commit without explicit user approval**
- ✅ **ALWAYS create feature branches for each improvement**
- ✅ **ALWAYS request user validation before any commits**
- ✅ **ONLY update documentation AFTER user approval**
- ✅ **ONLY stage and commit AFTER user approval**

### **PHASE WORKFLOW - MANDATORY**
1. **Create feature branch** for specific improvement (e.g., `feature/phase-7-distraction-free-mode`)
2. **Implement single improvement** completely on feature branch
3. **Request user testing** and validation of the specific improvement
4. **Wait for user approval** - DO NOT PROCEED WITHOUT IT
5. **Update documentation** only after approval
6. **Stage and commit** only after approval
7. **Merge to main** only after approval
8. **Start next improvement** on new feature branch

### **IMPROVEMENT-SPECIFIC WORKFLOW**
- **One improvement per branch** - No mixing of features
- **Complete implementation** before requesting validation
- **Comprehensive testing** of the specific improvement
- **User validation required** for each improvement individually
- **Documentation updates** for each completed improvement

## 🧪 **Testing Requirements for Each Improvement**
