# Performance Optimization Plan - Markdown Editor

## Overview
This document outlines a systematic approach to optimize the Markdown Editor application by removing debug code, fixing performance bottlenecks, and improving overall application responsiveness.

## Branching Strategy
- Each phase will be implemented in a separate branch: `perf-opt-phase-N`
- After user validation, changes will be committed and merged to main
- Only proceed to next phase after explicit user confirmation

---

2. Delete problematic branch: `git branch -D perf-opt-phase-N`
3. Report issues for investigation
4. Resume from previous working state

## Notes
- Each phase must be validated by user before proceeding
- Create detailed commit messages for each phase
- Document any unexpected issues or discoveries
- Keep performance measurements for comparison
