# üîç Drag-Drop Debug Testing Guide

## Test Files Created

### 1. `drag-drop-debug.html` - Browser-Only Test
- **Purpose**: Test what information is available through browser drag-drop events
- **Usage**: Open directly in any web browser
- **Expected**: Shows filename only, no absolute paths (browser security limitation)
C:\Users\Francisco\Documents\PROJECTS\travelling-bear-markdown-viewer-rust\vscode_extension.gif
### 2. `tauri-drag-debug.html` - Tauri Native Test  
- **Purpose**: Test Tauri's native `tauri://file-drop` events
- **Usage**: Needs to be opened in a Tauri application with `fileDropEnabled: true`
- **Expected**: Should show absolute file paths if working correctly

### 3. `drag-test-tauri.conf.json` - Test Configuration
- **Purpose**: Minimal Tauri config with `fileDropEnabled: true`
- **Usage**: For creating a test Tauri app to run the native test

## Testing Steps

### Step 1: Browser Test
1. Open `drag-drop-debug.html` in your web browser
2. Drag any file into the drop zone
3. Observe what path information is available
4. **Expected Result**: Only filename, no absolute path

### Step 2: Current App Test
1. Open your current Markdown Viewer app
2. Check the current `dragDropEnabled` setting in `Markdown Viewer/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`
3. Test drag-drop behavior in your app
4. Note what paths are available

### Step 3: Native Tauri Test (Advanced)
To test native Tauri drag-drop:
1. Temporarily change `dragDropEnabled: false` to `dragDropEnabled: true` in your main app
2. Open your app and test drag-drop
3. Check browser console for `tauri://file-drop` events
4. **Expected Result**: Should show absolute paths

## Key Questions to Answer

1. **Browser Events**: What path information do we get? (filename only?)
2. **Current Config**: What happens with `dragDropEnabled: false`?
3. **Native Events**: What happens with `dragDropEnabled: true`?
4. **Path Format**: Do we get absolute paths like `C:\path\to\file.md`?
5. **Windows UNC**: Do paths have `\\?\` prefix that needs cleaning?

## Analysis Goals

- Understand the trade-off between browser and native drag-drop
- Determine if we can get absolute paths for proper saving
- Test if native events work without breaking existing functionality
- Find the best configuration for your use case

## Next Steps Based on Results

### If Native Events Work:
- Enable `fileDropEnabled: true`
- Implement `tauri://file-drop` listener
- Get absolute paths for proper file saving

### If Native Events Don't Work:
- Keep current browser-based approach
- Document limitation (Save As required for drag-dropped files)
- Consider hybrid approach
