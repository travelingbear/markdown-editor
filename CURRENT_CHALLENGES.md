# Current Technical Challenges - Phase 5

## âœ… RESOLVED: Window Close Handler

### Problem (SOLVED)
The X button was closing the application without prompting for unsaved changes.

### Solution Implemented
1. **Fixed Tauri v2 onCloseRequested** - Proper event.preventDefault() implementation
2. **Added window permissions** - `core:window:allow-close` and `core:window:allow-destroy`
3. **Fixed save functionality** - Resolved file path issues causing crashes
4. **Proper confirmation flow** - Save/Don't Save/Cancel options working

### Technical Details
- **Tauri Version**: v2
- **Solution**: `onCloseRequested` with proper event handling and permissions
- **Status**: âœ… WORKING - User confirmed functionality
- **Impact**: Users no longer lose unsaved work

### Code Location
- File: `main.js`
- Function: `setupWindowCloseHandler()`
- Permissions: `src-tauri/capabilities/default.json`

## âœ… RESOLVED: Save Functionality

### Problem (SOLVED)
Save function was crashing the application due to file path permission issues.

### Solution Implemented
1. **Fixed drag-drop file paths** - Set `currentFile = null` for drag-dropped files
2. **Added proper error handling** - Prevents crashes on save errors
3. **Save As workflow** - Drag-dropped files use Save As dialog (browser security limitation)
4. **File permissions** - Added `fs:write-all` and proper scope configuration

### Current Behavior
- **Files opened via File > Open**: Save to original location
- **Files opened via drag-drop**: Use Save As dialog (security limitation)
- **No crashes**: Proper error handling implemented

## âœ… RESOLVED: Drag-Drop Functionality

### Status
- **Welcome Screen**: âœ… Working - Opens .md files
- **Code Mode**: âœ… Working - Inserts filenames
- **Visual Feedback**: âœ… Working - Blue overlay with context messages
- **File Opening**: âœ… Working - No longer marks as dirty

### Current Limitation
Drag-dropped files can't save to original location due to browser security. This is documented as a future enhancement opportunity.

## ðŸ”® FUTURE ENHANCEMENT: Native Drag-Drop

### Goal
Implement Tauri native drag-drop to get absolute file paths for proper saving.

### Current Limitation
- Browser drag-drop events can't access full file paths
- Drag-dropped files require "Save As" dialog

### Future Solution
1. Enable `dragDropEnabled: true` in Tauri config
2. Use Tauri `file-drop` events instead of browser events
3. Get absolute file paths for proper save functionality

### Priority
Low - Current functionality is acceptable, this is an enhancement

## ðŸ“Š Phase 5 Status - COMPLETE

### Completed
- âœ… Image & GIF support
- âœ… Drag-drop functionality (basic)
- âœ… Visual feedback improvements
- âœ… Window close handler
- âœ… Save functionality (stable)
- âœ… Final testing and validation

### Success Criteria for Phase 5
- [x] Images/GIFs working
- [x] Drag-drop functionality (basic)
- [x] **Window close handler working**

**Status**: âœ… PHASE 5 COMPLETE
**Next**: Ready for Phase 6 (Distribution)
**Future Enhancement**: Native Tauri drag-drop for full file path support
