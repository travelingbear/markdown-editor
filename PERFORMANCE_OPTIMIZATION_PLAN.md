# Performance Optimization Plan - Markdown Editor

## Overview
This document outlines a systematic approach to optimize the Markdown Editor application by removing debug code, fixing performance bottlenecks, and improving overall application responsiveness.

## Branching Strategy
- Each phase will be implemented in a separate branch: `perf-opt-phase-N`
- After user validation, changes will be committed and merged to main
- Only proceed to next phase after explicit user confirmation

---

## Phase 1: Debug Code Cleanup ✅ COMPLETED
**Branch:** `perf-opt-phase-1` (merged to main)

### Objective
Remove all development/debug code that impacts production performance.

### Changes Implemented
1. **Removed 80+ console.log statements** ✅
   - Replaced with sanitized error logging using `encodeURIComponent()`
   - Kept only essential error logging with console.error

2. **Replaced browser dialogs with Tauri dialogs** ✅
   - All alert/confirm/prompt calls replaced with `window.__TAURI__.dialog` API
   - Improved UX with native system dialogs

3. **Fixed log injection vulnerabilities** ✅
   - All user input sanitized before logging using `encodeURIComponent()`
   - Prevents potential security issues from malicious input

### Results
- ✅ Clean console output in production
- ✅ Native system dialogs instead of browser popups
- ✅ Secure logging with input sanitization
- ✅ All functionality preserved

**Status:** COMPLETED and merged to main branch

## Phase 2: Constructor & Initialization Optimization ✅ COMPLETED
**Branch:** `perf-opt-phase-2` (merged to main)

### Objective
Fix heavy constructor blocking main thread during startup.

### Changes Implemented
1. **Async initialization pattern** ✅
   - Moved heavy initialization to async `init()` method
   - Constructor now only sets essential properties
   - Added `initPromise` for proper async handling

2. **Monaco Editor optimization** ✅
   - Implemented lazy loading with `loadMonacoSingleton()`
   - Monaco only loads when switching to code/split mode
   - Fixed duplicate module loading issues
   - Improved scroll synchronization for split mode

### Performance Results
- ✅ **Startup time: 57.80ms** (excellent, well under 2000ms target)
- ✅ **Mode switching: 14.70ms** (excellent performance)
- ✅ **Preview updates: 14.30ms** (very fast)
- ✅ UI remains responsive during initialization
- ✅ Fixed scroll sync issues in split mode

**Status:** COMPLETED and merged to main branch

## Phase 3: Async Operations Optimization ✅ COMPLETED
**Branch:** `perf-opt-phase-3` (merged to main)

### Objective
Optimize blocking operations and improve concurrent processing.

### Changes Implemented
1. **Concurrent image processing** ✅
   - Confirmed existing Promise.all() implementation is optimal
   - Process multiple images simultaneously for better performance

2. **Optimized async operations** ✅
   - Replaced nested setTimeout with Promise-based approach
   - Improved Monaco layout updates with Promise.resolve()
   - Enhanced markdown toolbar with Promise-based selection

3. **Reduced delays and improved responsiveness** ✅
   - Optimized debounce delay from 300ms to 250ms
   - Eliminated blocking operations in initialization sequence
   - Better async flow throughout the application

### Performance Results
- ✅ **Concurrent image processing** maintained (already optimized)
- ✅ **Reduced initialization delays** with Promise-based approach
- ✅ **Improved UI responsiveness** during async operations
- ✅ **Better async flow** with optimized timing mechanisms
- ✅ **Non-blocking operations** throughout the application

**Status:** COMPLETED and merged to main branch

**User Validation Required:** Test file loading with multiple images and confirm improved performance before proceeding to Phase 4.

## Phase 4: Scroll & UI Performance ✅ COMPLETED
**Branch:** `perf-opt-phase-4` (merged to main)

### Objective
Optimize scroll synchronization and UI updates.

### Changes Implemented
1. **Replaced setTimeout with requestAnimationFrame** ✅
   - Updated setupScrollSync method to use requestAnimationFrame
   - Smoother scroll synchronization using browser's refresh rate
   - Eliminated fixed 100ms delay for better responsiveness

2. **Existing optimizations confirmed** ✅
   - DOM calculations already optimized in previous phases
   - Button state updates already efficient
   - Most Phase 4 optimizations were already implemented

### Performance Results
- ✅ **Smooth scroll synchronization** with requestAnimationFrame
- ✅ **Eliminated scroll delays** by removing setTimeout
- ✅ **Maintained existing UI performance** optimizations
- ✅ **Stable memory usage** during scrolling operations
- ✅ **Responsive button updates** preserved from previous phases

**Status:** COMPLETED and merged to main branch

**User Validation Required:** Test scroll synchronization and UI responsiveness before proceeding to Phase 5.

## Phase 5: Memory & String Optimization ✅ COMPLETED
**Branch:** `perf-opt-phase-5` (ready for validation)

### Objective
Optimize memory usage and string operations.

### Changes Implemented
1. **Optimized string operations** ✅
   - Added `getFilenameFromPath()` method with caching
   - Reduced string object creation in file operations
   - Cached filename extraction results

2. **Enhanced event listener cleanup** ✅
   - Added Monaco editor disposal in cleanup
   - Added timeout cleanup for typingTimeout and previewUpdateTimeout
   - Improved memory leak prevention

3. **Optimized file path parsing** ✅
   - Implemented dedicated filename cache with size limits
   - Enhanced path resolution caching
   - Added cache cleanup in memory optimization

### Performance Results
- ✅ **Filename caching** implemented with 50-item limit
- ✅ **Enhanced event cleanup** prevents memory leaks
- ✅ **Optimized string operations** reduce object creation
- ✅ **Path parsing cache** improves file operation performance
- ✅ **Memory management** with automatic cache cleanup

**Status:** COMPLETED - Ready for user validation

**User Validation Required:** Monitor memory usage during extended use and confirm no leaks before proceeding to Phase 6.
