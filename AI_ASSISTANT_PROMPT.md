10. **Complete Phase 7**: All UI/UX enhancements finished

## üö´ **KNOWN ISSUES & TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Markdown Toolbar Double-Click Selection Issue**
- **Problem**: Formatting buttons don't work with double-click word selection in Monaco Editor
- **Workaround**: Use drag selection instead of double-click
- **Root Cause**: Monaco Editor's `getSelection()` and `getSelections()` don't reliably detect double-click selections
- **Attempted Fixes**: 
  - Tried `getSelections()` array method
  - Added `selection.isEmpty()` checks
  - Enhanced selection validation
- **Next Steps**: May need to listen to Monaco's selection change events or use different selection API
- **Impact**: Minor UX issue, drag selection works perfectly
