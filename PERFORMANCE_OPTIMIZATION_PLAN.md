# Performance Optimization Plan - Markdown Editor

## Overview
This document outlines a systematic approach to optimize the Markdown Editor application by removing debug code, fixing performance bottlenecks, and improving overall application responsiveness.

## Branching Strategy
- Each phase will be implemented in a separate branch: `perf-opt-phase-N`
- After user validation, changes will be committed and merged to main
- Only proceed to next phase after explicit user confirmation

---

## Phase 1: Debug Code Cleanup ✅ COMPLETED
**Branch:** `perf-opt-phase-1` (merged to main)

### Objective
Remove all development/debug code that impacts production performance.

### Changes Implemented
1. **Removed 80+ console.log statements** ✅
   - Replaced with sanitized error logging using `encodeURIComponent()`
   - Kept only essential error logging with console.error

2. **Replaced browser dialogs with Tauri dialogs** ✅
   - All alert/confirm/prompt calls replaced with `window.__TAURI__.dialog` API
   - Improved UX with native system dialogs

3. **Fixed log injection vulnerabilities** ✅
   - All user input sanitized before logging using `encodeURIComponent()`
   - Prevents potential security issues from malicious input

### Results
- ✅ Clean console output in production
- ✅ Native system dialogs instead of browser popups
- ✅ Secure logging with input sanitization
- ✅ All functionality preserved

**Status:** COMPLETED and merged to main branch

---

## Phase 2: Constructor & Initialization Optimization ✅ COMPLETED
**Branch:** `perf-opt-phase-2` (merged to main)

### Objective
Fix heavy constructor blocking main thread during startup.

### Changes Implemented
1. **Async initialization pattern** ✅
   - Moved heavy initialization to async `init()` method
   - Constructor now only sets essential properties
   - Added `initPromise` for proper async handling

2. **Monaco Editor optimization** ✅
   - Implemented lazy loading with `loadMonacoSingleton()`
   - Monaco only loads when switching to code/split mode
   - Fixed duplicate module loading issues
   - Improved scroll synchronization for split mode

### Performance Results
- ✅ **Startup time: 57.80ms** (excellent, well under 2000ms target)
- ✅ **Mode switching: 14.70ms** (excellent performance)
- ✅ **Preview updates: 14.30ms** (very fast)
- ✅ UI remains responsive during initialization
- ✅ Fixed scroll sync issues in split mode

**Status:** COMPLETED and merged to main branch

   - Use single template literals
   - Reduce string object creation

2. **Fix event listener cleanup** (lines 2877-2880)
   - Ensure proper cleanup of event handlers
   - Prevent memory leaks

3. **Optimize file path parsing** (lines 3339-3340)

## Notes
- Each phase must be validated by user before proceeding
- Create detailed commit messages for each phase
- Document any unexpected issues or discoveries
- Keep performance measurements for comparison
